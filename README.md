# Trivia-Game
Test your knowledge in this Trivia game. Answer 10 or 15 questions and try to get to the top of the leaderboard... 

## How to run:
Download the entire project and just run "Interface.py". It should automatically create the SQLite database, and the game engine.
The only libraries needed are SQLAlchemy, Pygame, Requests, Webbrowser, time and random. Either way I'm adding a requirements.txt.
